    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400ºF. Line a baking sheet. The piece of foil should be large enough to fold over and seal the fish.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, add lemon juice, garlic, and melted butter or melted ghee. Whisk everything together.</li>
        <li>Place the salmon on the prepared baking sheet. Pour the butter mixture over the salmon</li>
        <li>Season with salt, pepper, oregano, and red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Fold the sides of the foil over the salmon. Make sure it is well sealed so that the sauce does not leak. Place the pan into the oven, and bake until cooked, about 12-16 minutes. The cooking time depends on the thickness of the fillet.</li>
        <li>Open the foil, and broil the fish for 2-3 minutes. Be careful not to burn the fish!</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven. Using a spoon, pour some of the butter sauce left in the foil onto the salmon before serving. Then, garnish with fresh chopped parsley and lemon slices.</li>
